# ArduinoAndroidMeshNetwork
Embedded project, working on creating a network using Arduino, LoRa, and Bluetooth, alongside the creation of a supplementary Android application.

Libraries contains libraries we're using for Ardunio.

Arduino Application contains our main code which connects bluetooth, LoRa, and arduino. Currently can connect to an android appliction and maintin bidirectional communication. LoRa however can only unidirectionally send messages.

LoRa is just for testing LoRa functionality currently can communicate between two LoRa devices
